Based on https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:CustomSidebar which is unfortunately abandoned and not working with current mediawiki versions anymore. Here we make it run with current mediawiki versions (tested with mediawiki 1.35.1)
* TODO check http://wiki.4intra.net/CustomSidebar - have they done a similar thing?
* TODO systematically go through this and maybe at some point make this an official extension again?
